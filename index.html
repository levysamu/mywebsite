	      There are many cats in my life. This is both great and a cause for some disappointment. While I really like the cats that I and the people around me own, I deeply wish that there was at least one dog in my life.

	          <i>Eliza is my cat. I adopted her about 2 years ago from a pet shelter in California in order to scare off the mice in my house. She's kind of big (to be read "fat"). She is active, sweet, an alpha, sort of dumb, and she absolutely does not get along with other cats unless they are 100% willing to accept her dominance. I cherish her. </i></p>
	        <p id="PrincessBio">
	          <i>Princess is my fiance's cat. I'm not overly fond of her. She is difficult to win over, perhaps as a result of the fact that she is both fearful and weak. She is completely terrified of Eliza and essentially needs to be kept in a separate room.</i></p>
	        <p id="CatsbyBio">
	          <i>Catsby is my current roommate's cat. He is fat, lazy, a bit of a dullard, but tremendously easygoing and willing to accept whatever indignities we thrust upon him. Sometimes he cries and it is both tremendously sad and immensely endearing.</i></p>
